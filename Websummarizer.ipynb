      "An Overview of the Education System in Kenya\n",
      "Hollie Nielsen\n",
      "Education Articles\n",
      "27 January 2024\n",
      "by Hollie Nielsen, AWC Central Scotland and AWC London\n",
      "In January, the Education Team is focusing on\n",
      "SDG Target 4.5: eliminate gender disparities in education\n",
      ". In addition, because our\n",
      "Target Project 5 Awesome Blossoms\n",
      "is located in Nairobi, Kenya, this month we are also looking at education in Kenya, including in the slums.\n",
      "The Kenyan national educational system consists of three levels: eight years of compulsory primary education (beginning at age six), four years at the secondary level, and four years of higher education. The government provides free primary and secondary education. Entrance into secondary school is contingent upon obtaining the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education by passing a national exam. Kenya’s literacy rate, at more than four-fifths of the population, is high for sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Pre-pandemic, nationwide enrolment in primary school was 93%; however, only 63% of Kenyan boys and 68% of girls complete primary education, and only 53% enroll in secondary school. In addition, while Kenya has reached gender parity at the primary school level, few girls fully complete their secondary education due to several socio-economic factors, including teenage pregnancies, early marriages, poverty and lack of mentorship.\n",
      "Despite the Kenyan government prioritizing education, Kenyan public education is rife with inadequate facilities, insufficient and often poorly trained teachers, overcrowded classrooms and poor results. The teacher deficit stands at over 90,000. Until the 2022 order to hire 30,000 new teachers, only enough were employed to replace those retiring or leaving the profession through natural attrition. The lack of infrastructure is a challenge which the government hasn’t met over the years. Some learners continue to attend lessons under trees.\n",
      "Kenya has huge regional inequalities in all education outcomes, with much lower outcomes in rural areas and for lower-income populations, especially those in the slums. Nine in ten children from poor households fail to complete eighth grade. Compounded by the pandemic, these challenges have led to learning losses and deepened inequalities in education. Around 17 million students and more than 320,000 teachers were affected by the closure of 30,000 primary and secondary schools in 2020. Efforts to provide remote learning revealed a significant digital divide, with over 50% of the students being left out, mainly due to lack of appropriate electronic devices, access to electricity and internet connectivity.\n",
      "Nairobi has a population of 3 million, half of whom live in slum conditions. The two largest slums in Nairobi are Kibera and Mathare Valley. In Kibera, there are no public schools and there are over 100,000 orphaned children. 43% of the girls and 29% of the boys attend no school at all. In Mathare Valley, there are two public schools for 70,000 students. Although primary education is free, students must wear school uniforms, which is a barrier to entry for children living in the slums. In slum areas, class size is often 100 students, with five students frequently sharing a desk. The absence of free secondary schooling in slums means that many of the young people there are excluded from education after age 14. Children who are not engaged in school through the eighth grade are quickly consumed by a culture of gangs, drugs and criminal activity for boys, and a world of rape, exploitation, and prostitution resulting in early, unwanted pregnancy for girls. Many thousands of youngsters in Kenya from slum communities grow up without hope – without the opportunities and skills that would enable them, against the odds, to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness.\n",
      "A teacher at a primary school in the informal settlement of Mathare in Nairobi—who described her students as “promising young boys and girls from extremely poor backgrounds”—illustrated this dynamic of multidimensional poverty during the pandemic: “Our pupils live in slums grappling with sanitization issues like lack of water. They live with siblings and extended family relatives in small houses and lack basic items like food. Most of the parents to these children have lost their sources of livelihoods due to the pandemic, making their already strained living conditions much worse.”\n",
      "Kenya: Submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n",
      "“Learning remains one of the most critical assets for any country to promote equitable growth and poverty reduction, and that cannot happen without a solid foundation,” said\n",
      "Pedro Cerdan-Infantes, World Bank Senior Economist\n",
      ". “While the Education sector faces treacherous sources of inequality including uneven quality and results, Kenya has embarked on ambitious reforms to address the quality issues rather than considering the job done by virtue of near-universal access and coverage.” Let’s hope the reforms lead to better results for all children, especially girls and children living in the slums.\n",

In addition, because our\\nTarget Project 5 Awesome Blossoms\\nis located in Nairobi, Kenya, this month we are also looking at education in Kenya, including in the slums.\\nThe Kenyan national educational system consists of three levels: eight years of compulsory primary education\\xa0(beginning at age six), four years at the secondary level, and four years of higher education. The government provides free primary and secondary education. Entrance into secondary school is contingent\\xa0upon obtaining the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education by passing a national exam. Kenya’s literacy rate, at more than four-fifths of the population, is high for sub-Saharan Africa.\\nPre-pandemic, nationwide enrolment in primary school was 93%; however, only 63% of Kenyan boys and 68% of girls complete primary education, and only 53% enroll in secondary school. In addition, while Kenya has reached gender parity at the primary school level, few girls fully complete their secondary education due to several socio-economic factors, including teenage pregnancies, early marriages, poverty and lack of mentorship.\\nDespite the Kenyan government prioritizing education, Kenyan public education is rife with inadequate facilities, insufficient and often poorly trained teachers, overcrowded classrooms and poor results. The teacher deficit stands at over 90,000. Until the 2022 order to hire 30,000 new teachers, only enough were employed to replace those retiring or leaving the profession through natural attrition. The lack of infrastructure is a challenge which the government hasn’t met over the years. Some learners continue to attend lessons under trees.\\nKenya has huge regional inequalities in all education outcomes, with much lower outcomes in rural areas and for lower-income populations, especially those in the slums.\\xa0Nine in ten children from poor households fail to complete eighth grade. Compounded by the pandemic, these challenges have led to learning losses and deepened inequalities in education. Around 17 million students and more than 320,000 teachers were affected by the closure of 30,000 primary and secondary schools in 2020. Efforts to provide remote learning revealed a significant digital divide, with over 50% of the students being left out, mainly due to lack of appropriate electronic devices, access to electricity and internet connectivity.\\nNairobi has a population of 3 million, half of whom live in slum conditions. The two largest slums in Nairobi are Kibera and Mathare Valley. In Kibera, there are no public schools and there are over 100,000 orphaned children. 43% of the girls and 29% of the boys attend no school at all. In Mathare Valley, there are two public schools for 70,000 students. Although primary education is free, students must wear school uniforms, which is a barrier to entry for children living in the slums. In slum areas, class size is often 100 students, with five students frequently sharing a desk. The absence of free secondary schooling in slums means that many of the young people there are excluded from education after age 14. Children who are not engaged in school through the eighth grade are quickly consumed by a culture of gangs, drugs and criminal activity for boys, and a world of rape, exploitation, and prostitution resulting in early, unwanted pregnancy for girls. Many thousands of youngsters in Kenya from slum communities grow up without hope\\xa0– without the opportunities and skills that would enable them, against the odds, to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness.\\nA teacher at a primary school in the informal settlement of Mathare in Nairobi—who described her students as “promising young boys and girls from extremely poor backgrounds”—illustrated this dynamic of multidimensional poverty during the pandemic: “Our pupils live in slums grappling with sanitization issues like lack of water. They live with siblings and extended family relatives in small houses and lack basic items like food. Most of the parents to these children have lost their sources of livelihoods due to the pandemic, making their already strained living conditions much worse.”\\nKenya: Submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\\n“Learning remains one of the most critical assets for any country to promote equitable growth and poverty reduction, and that cannot happen without a solid foundation,” said\\nPedro Cerdan-Infantes, World Bank Senior Economist\\n. “While the Education sector faces treacherous sources of inequality including uneven quality and results, Kenya has embarked on ambitious reforms to address the quality issues rather than considering the job done by virtue of near-universal access and coverage.” Let’s hope the reforms lead to better results for all children, especially girls and children living in the slums.\\nReferences:\\nKenya\\xa0– Education, Literacy, Schools | Britannica\\nKenya’s school reform is entering a new phase in 2023 – but the country isn’t ready\\nLessons from Kenya’s Education Reforms\\nEducation in Kenya – EACDT\\nFrom Evidence to Policy-Making: What Should Be In Kenya’s Next Education and Training Gender Policy? | Center For Global Development\\nHelping more girls complete basic education in Kenya\\nKenya: Submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\\nCheery Children Education Centre\\nPhoto from Canva.com\\nSDG4\\nTarget Project\\nEducationTeam\\nKenya\\nPrev\\nNext\\nShare This Content\\nShare\\nTweet\\nShare\\nEmail\\nVisit Our Partners\\nPublications\\nAnnual Reports\\nInspiring Women\\nSubscribe Page\\nThe Red Book\\nFAWCO Books\\nBooks by Clubs\\nBooks By Members\\nThe Red Book\\nDigital Media / Sponsorship\\nDigital Media\\nAdvertise with Us\\nPartners\\nPathways to Safety\\nOverseas Vote Foundation\\nFAWCO Foundation\\nEducation Awards\\nDevelopment Grants\\nEvents\\nUpcoming Conference\\nAll Past Conferences\\nRegional Meetings\\nVirtual Events\\nFAUSA\\nRepatriation How-To\\nJoin FAUSA\\nExtras\\nMake a Donation to FAWCO\\nContact FAWCO\\nSite Search\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookie Policy\\nMember Login\\nRemember Me\\nLog in\\nForgot your username and/or password?\\nSign up\\nLogin with FAWCO email\\n© 2025 FAWCO\\nSearch ...\\nSign In\\nHome\\nAbout\\nFAWCO News\\nWho We Are\\nBoard\\nVolunteers\\nHow We Work\\nMission Statement\\nResolutions & Recommendations\\nHistory\\nFAWCO Awards\\nSupport FAWCO\\nFAWCO Calendar\\nEvents\\nConferences\\nRegional Meetings\\nVirtual Events\\nPublications\\nInspiring Women\\nSubscribe to Bulletins & E-Newsletters\\nThe Red Book\\nAnnual Reports\\nMedia & Sponsorship\\nDigital Media\\nAdvertise with Us\\nMembers\\nMember News\\nNews from Our Clubs\\nNews in Brief\\nConnections\\nAdministration\\nFAWCO Directory\\nClub Profiles\\nMedia Assets\\nFAWCO Operating Docs\\nWeb Services\\nBulletins & E-Newsletters\\nConsidering Volunteering?\\nCommittees, Teams People List\\nAdministrative Committees\\nLeadership\\nFAWCO Reps\\nClub Presidents\\nRegional Coordinators\\nFAWCO Award Recipients\\nClub Development\\nBest Practices\\nClub Workshops\\nMember to Member\\nBooks By Members\\nList of Books By Members\\nBooks By Clubs\\nA Day in Your City\\nClubs in Motion\\nHeart Pillows\\nJoin FAWCO\\nHow to Join\\nIs Your Club Ready to Join?\\nUN Advocacy\\nUN Advocacy Articles\\nFAWCO At the UN\\nFAWCO UN Reps Team\\nAdvocacy\\nHistory\\nUN Reps and Global Issues\\nUN Reps and Education\\nUN Reps and Environment\\nUN Reps and Health\\nUN Reps and Human Rights\\nMigration\\nUN Youth\\nGender Equality\\nGender Equality Articles\\nCommission on the Status of Women\\nCommunications\\nCSW Blogs\\nUN Climate Conference Blogs\\nUN Reps Annual Reports\\nReports to the UN\\nSDG Awareness\\nSDG Awareness Articles\\nUS Issues\\nUS Issues News\\nOverseas Americans Week\\nUS Issues Articles\\nUS Voting\\nUS Voting Articles\\nUS Citizenship\\nUS Citizenship Articles\\nUS Tax & Banking\\nUS Tax & Banking Articles\\nTax\\nFATCA\\nGlobal Issues\\nGlobal Issues News\\nGlobal Issues Articles\\nEducation\\nEducation Articles\\nRecommended Books\\nEnvironment\\nEnvironment Articles\\nRecommended Books\\nHealth\\nHealth Articles\\nClubs in Motion\\nHuman Rights\\nHuman Rights Articles\\nEnding Violence\\nFAWCO Refugee Network\\nHuman Trafficking\\nTarget Program\\nHuman Rights 2025-2028\\nEnvironment 2022-2025\\nHealth 2019-2022\\nEducation 2016-2019\\nHuman Rights 2013-2016\\nEnvironment 2009-2013\\nYouth Program\\nCultural Volunteers\"}]\n"

       "'## Summary of \"An Overview of the Education System in Kenya\"\\n\\nThe article by Hollie Nielsen outlines key aspects of the education system in Kenya, particularly the challenges faced by students in slum areas. \\n\\n- **Educational Structure**: The system comprises three levels: eight years of compulsory primary education, four years of secondary education, and four years of higher education. The government provides free primary and secondary education. However, completion rates are significantly lower, with only 63% of boys and 68% of girls finishing primary education, and a mere 53% enrolling in secondary school.\\n\\n- **Issues in Education**: Although Kenya has achieved relatively high literacy rates (over 80%), the quality of education suffers from inadequate facilities, overcrowded classrooms, and a severe shortage of qualified teachers. A deficit of over 90,000 teachers persists, and many students attend classes in unsuitable conditions, like makeshift classrooms or under trees.\\n\\n- **Impact of Socio-Economic Factors**: Gender disparities continue, particularly in slum areas where socio-economic factors such as poverty, teenage pregnancy, and early marriage hinder girls\\' education. In Nairobi\\'s slums, access to quality education is severely restricted, with many children either lacking basic school supplies or unable to afford uniforms, which are mandatory despite the tuition-free policy.\\n\\n- **Consequences of the Pandemic**: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, with over 17 million students affected by school closures, and the shift to remote learning revealed a significant digital divide. Many rural and lower-income students were unable to participate due to a lack of resources.\\n\\n- **Future Prospects**: The Kenyan government is implementing reforms to enhance educational quality, focusing on the urgent need to address these disparities, especially for vulnerable populations in slums.\\n\\nThis overview emphasizes the critical nature of education for national growth and the urgent need for improvements to create equal opportunities for all children, particularly those disadvantaged by socio-economic factors.'"

       "'# Summary of \"An Overview of the Education System in Kenya\"\\n\\nThe article, authored by Hollie Nielsen, explores the educational landscape in Kenya with a specific focus on gender disparities and the challenges faced by students, particularly in slum areas. It outlines the structure of Kenya\\'s education system, which consists of:\\n\\n- **Primary Education:** Eight years, compulsory starting at age six with free schooling provided by the government.\\n- **Secondary Education:** Four years, accessible upon passing the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education.\\n- **Higher Education:** Four years, following secondary school.\\n\\nKey findings include:\\n\\n- Although the literacy rate exceeds 80%, there are significant challenges in primary and secondary school completion, especially for girls. Factors hindering these completions include teenage pregnancies, early marriages, poverty, and lack of mentorship.\\n- Only 63% of boys and 68% of girls complete primary education, with mere 53% enrolling in secondary school.\\n- The public education system faces substantial issues such as overcrowded classrooms, inadequate facilities, and a teacher shortage exceeding 90,000.\\n- The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, with 17 million students affected by school closures and more than 50% lacking access to remote learning due to the digital divide.\\n\\nIn urban slum areas like Kibera and Mathare, the situation is particularly dire, marked by a lack of public schools and the prevalence of socio-economic challenges. The culture of gangs, drugs, and exploitation further impacts students, particularly for those who drop out of school.\\n\\nThe article concludes with a call for ongoing reforms in Kenya’s education sector, which aim to improve quality and eliminate inequalities, particularly for girls and students in underprivileged areas.\\n\\n### Additional Context:\\nThe article is part of a broader initiative focusing on SDG Target 4.5, which seeks to eliminate gender disparities in education globally.'"
